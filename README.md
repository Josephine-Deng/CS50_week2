# What do I do
This project is a part of CS50 coursework,I use python to perform statistics on randomly generated numbers.

# Technologies used
-python 3.x
-Git & GitHub for version control

# project description
This is a project demonstrates how to process random number by using different built-in funtions in python.
-use the basic function len(),min(),max(),sum() to output statistical details.
-use .sort() or .sort(reverse=True) to sort the numbers in ascending and descending order.
-use for loop and if statements to compare each number with the average.

# What I learned
-how to use functions to extract useful information, for exxample the length or sun of numbers.
-what arrays are in both in python and C, and hoe they are used in program.
-What command-line arguments and exit status mean in C.
-how to fix the formatting issues and develope the project logic.

# Project files
'statistic_the_number.py': my python inplementation

# Next step
-continue to study CS50-week3 and improve my C programming skills.
-practice writing mor effective summaries to reflect on each course module.
